## Security

- [!] Consider per-user API keys with real role mapping to replace the single
  shared `SECRET_KEY` (see ADR 0001, which states finer-grained keys need their
  own ADR). Less urgent since 2026-07-26, when the shared key stopped mapping to
  `admin` and got the fixed `API_KEY_PERMISSIONS` set instead, but the remaining
  gaps are unchanged: one secret for every client, no per-client attribution, no
  revocation without rotating for everyone. Needs product decisions before
  implementation: key scoping model, rotation and revocation UX, whether the
  existing shared `SECRET_KEY` keeps working during migration, and where hashed
  keys live in the schema. Blocked on those four answers, not on effort: an
  implementation that guesses them is worse than none. Smallest unblock: the
  owner picks a scoping model and a revocation story, ideally as an ADR
  alongside 0001, and the schema plus migration follow from it.

## Artificial Intelligence

- [ ] Decide whether the diagnostics prompt should stop the model emitting
      markdown fences. The rewritten prompt still says "No markdown fences", and
      the parser strips them (`parseError` was null on all 10 eval runs), but 2
      of 6 runs on the new wording wrapped the JSON in a ```json fence where 0
      of 2 baseline runs did. Two baseline samples cannot establish that as a
      regression, and nothing breaks today. Smallest next step: 4 more baseline
      runs to see whether the rates actually differ before touching the wording.
- [!] Verify the diagnostics AI rollout plan against a live provider call
  (implemented 2026-07-24 with prompt+parser tests only; no end-to-end AI call
  was run). Blocked: needs a real provider API key and spends paid model quota,
  which this run has no authorization for. Smallest unblock: the user names the
  provider/key and authorizes one metered call.

## Agent Access

- [ ] Build a machine-first access surface so agents can query the instance
      without driving the UI (owner request, 2026-08-18). Concrete first
      consumer: the hosting-estate sessions, where an agent answered "is the
      estate clean enough to raise p=none -> quarantine?" by SSH-ing into the
      mail server and parsing 979 RUA reports with ad-hoc scripts — everything
      it needed (per-domain pass/fail, failing sources, alignment detail for
      own-server mail) already exists behind the dashboard, but only as rendered
      pages. Wants a product decision on shape before code: (a) a documented
      read-only REST surface over the existing queries (domains, top senders,
      per-domain alignment breakdown, ingestion health) returning JSON; (b) a
      CLI wrapper on top of that; (c) an MCP server exposing the same queries as
      tools, which is the shape agents consume natively. These are layers, not
      alternatives — (a) is the foundation either way. Auth is the real
      coupling: today the only key is the shared `SECRET_KEY` with fixed
      `API_KEY_PERMISSIONS`, so a read-only agent key ties directly into the
      blocked per-user API-key item above (ADR 0001) — an agent surface is
      exactly the client that wants a scoped, revocable key rather than the
      master secret. Smallest next step: pick the endpoint list from the queries
      the 2026-08-18 hosting-estate session actually ran (they are the demand, written
      down in that repo's `scripts/dmarc-report-summary.sh` and `TODO_LOG.md`),
      and decide whether the agent key rides the existing shared-key model or
      waits for ADR 0001's successor.

## Infrastructure

- [!] Re-upgrade `typescript` to a plain spec once typescript-eslint supports
  TS >= 7.1 (their issue #10940). Until then the repo uses the dual-alias
  interop: `typescript` -> `@typescript/typescript6` (JS API for
  eslint/Next/prettier plugins) and `typescript-7` -> native `tsc` used by
  `type-check`. The `typescript-eslint` overrides in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` exist
  because `eslint-config-next` pins 8.59.x. Re-checked 2026-07-26: unchanged —
  8.65.0 is still `latest` and both it and the 8.65.1-alpha.7 canary declare
  `typescript >=4.8.4 <6.1.0`. See ADR 0005.

## Performance

- [-] Stop re-fetching envelopes for folders that never carry DMARC mail.
  Decided 2026-08-26: not this project's problem to solve. With
  `ingestion_include_all_folders` on, `processFolder` runs one IMAP
  `SEARCH SINCE` per folder and then bulk-fetches the envelope of every UID it
  returns, because the DMARC subject test (`isDmarcCandidate`) and the
  `processed_messages` de-duplication both need the envelope. Measured on the
  nova mailbox: a `.Logs` folder holds 5,038 messages of which 5,037 fall inside
  the 30-day window, so every hourly run pulls ~5,000 envelopes to discard all
  of them, while the run's real work is 1-22 reports. The 30-day window added on
  2026-08-25 does not help — the noise folder is entirely recent, so bounding by
  date bounds nothing. The owner is moving that log mail out to a separate
  processor, which removes the cost at source and is cheaper than a folder
  allow-list plus its migration and UI. Reopen only if a mailbox shows the same
  cost with no way to drain the noisy folder.

- [ ] Revisit rollup-style pre-aggregation for `getTopIpSenders` once the
      dataset justifies it. Measured 2026-07-26 against the local dev DB (6,901
      `normalized_events`, 2,178 `raw_reports`, 899 IPs, 51 domains): the query
      returns in ~20ms, most of it `sqlite3` CLI overhead, so a rollup table
      would be speculative complexity today. The 2026-07-26 domain-scoping
      change also improved the restricted-user path from
      `SCAN normalized_events` to
      `SEARCH ... USING INDEX event_domain_end_count_idx`. Reconsider when
      `normalized_events` reaches the "millions of rows" the
      `event_rollup_daily` doc comment describes; the rollup would need
      `domain_id` in its key to stay compatible with the allow-list filter, plus
      a migration, ingest-transaction maintenance, a backfill path, and an ADR
      0008-style consistency test.

## Pending Decisions

- [!] Decide whether ingested DMARC mail should be deleted outright or keep the
  current "move to Trash" behaviour. Verified 2026-09-08 against the production
  mailbox: there is no bug. The account has `move_to_trash_after_process` on,
  `handleMoveToTrash` issues `messageMove` to the `\Trash` mailbox (the
  2026-08-26 decision to honour the label rather than expunge), zero
  post-process failures in 30 days of journal, and the Trash held 540 messages
  dated from the moment that fix was deployed. The INBOX leftovers are all
  non-DMARC alerts. Actual deletion happens outside the app: a daily cron on the
  mail server expunges Trash older than 30 days, so the effective retention is
  30 days. Owner's call, two options: shorten that retention on the server (one
  number in the cron), or add an explicit `delete` post-process option in the
  app alongside "move to trash". Do not change either without the answer. Side
  note from the same check: `fetch_include_all_folders` is on, so every hourly
  run also scans the ~8,400-message log folder; the Performance entry above
  already records that as accepted cost.

- [!] Match the domain score to PowerDMARC's output exactly. Decided 2026-07-26:
  parity is the goal, so any divergence in the
  SPF/DKIM/DMARC/BIMI/MTA-STS/TLS-RPT weights is a bug, not a design choice.
  Blocked on reference data this run cannot obtain: PowerDMARC's scores are
  behind their account, and scraping or signing up for a third-party service is
  not something to do unattended. Smallest unblock: the user supplies a handful
  of domains with PowerDMARC's reported score for each (a spread of
  good/partial/broken configurations is worth more than many similar ones); then
  `computeDomainScore` can be diffed against them and the weights tuned, with
  the reference set pinned as a test. Note 2026-07-24: the DKIM key-length
  estimator fix changed reported bit values, so any reference capture must
  post-date it.

## Future Ideas

Product/design work, deliberately not started autonomously: each one changes
what the diagnostics page _is_, so it wants a brief on the intended reading
order and information hierarchy before any code.

- [ ] Redesign the diagnostics page as one editorial narrative instead of
      stacked cards.
- [ ] Add expand/collapse controls to each protocol section.
- [ ] Generate copy-ready DNS examples from the inspected domain's real values
      instead of generic placeholders.

## Baseline gate debt

Frozen when the repo adopted the shared `@busirocket/*` toolchain. Every gate
passes today; each entry below is a pre-existing finding held in place by a
named exemption rather than a wildcard, so new violations of the same rule still
fail.

Most of this is gone as of 2026-08-27. The knip exemptions went first: the 23
dead files, the 124 unused exports and the nine unused dependencies were deleted
rather than ignored, so `knip.config.ts` carries no `ignore` list, no
`ignoreDependencies` and no rule override. The dependency-cruiser exemptions
followed: all 77 barrel-mediated cycles are gone, so `no-circular` runs
unnarrowed and the two stale orphan exemptions are deleted. What remains below
is what those passes did not reach.

- [ ] Refine the remaining eleven deep-import exceptions in `eslint.config.ts`.
      Each exists because importing the slice barrel would close a module cycle
      that `no-circular` rejects, so `import/no-internal-modules` is turned off
      for that file by name. The `config`/`settings` pair was resolved
      2026-08-28 and proved the pattern: the row readers both slices needed
      moved to `services/settings-store`, both former exceptions import barrels
      now, and `no-circular` stays clean — see TODO_LOG. Three mutual pairs
      remain (`auth`/`api`/`install`, `ai/core`/`ai/settings`,
      `types/ingest`/`utils/ingest`); apply the same probe to each: find what
      each side actually needs from the other, and extract the third thing if it
      is a symbol or two. Do not widen the list to a glob — named entries are
      what keeps a new deep import failing.

- [ ] Adopt the `@busirocket/eslint-config` factories now that the source is
      fixed. The 886-violation hardening finished 2026-08-28: all of `jsx-a11y`,
      `react/jsx-no-leaked-render` and `no-unsafe-*` are at zero against the
      scratch `eslint.audit.config.ts`, with no rule disabled and no
      `eslint-disable` added anywhere. The only remaining findings are the 21
      `security/detect-non-literal-fs-filename`, audited one by one on
      2026-08-28: every flagged path is built from constants, `process.cwd()`,
      env, or drizzle's own migration journal — none is reachable from request
      input — so resolve them at adoption time as rule configuration (off for
      `test/**`, and either off or documented for the seven server files), not
      per-line disables. Adoption itself: add
      `@busirocket/eslint-config@^0.7.3`, point `eslint.config.ts` at its
      factories, confirm the swap reports zero new errors, then delete
      `eslint.audit.config.ts` plus its `tsconfig.json` exclude and
      `allowDefaultProject` entries.

- [ ] Re-check `extract-zip`: the advisory names `>=2.0.2` and no such release
      exists. Closed here by overriding `@puppeteer/browsers` to `^3.2.1`, which
      dropped the dependency for `modern-tar`. Drop the override if `@lhci/cli`
      ever ships a version that no longer needs it. Re-checked 2026-08-28:
      unchanged — `@lhci/cli` latest is still 0.15.1, pinning
      `lighthouse@12.6.1`; the override stays.
